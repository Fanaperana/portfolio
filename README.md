## TL;DR

- **Who:** Fanaperana — software engineer focused on Rust, TypeScript, and agentic AI.
- **What I like:** low-level tools, tiny languages, unusual operating systems, beautiful terminals,
  node-based editors, and everything that blurs the line between desktop app and web.
- **What this repo is:** the source of the portfolio site itself. No template, no headless CMS — a
  Rust → WASM mini-shell driving a Svelte 5 frontend.
- **Hiring?** Scroll to [Looking for work](#looking-for-work--contact).

## What this site is

- A handwritten portfolio — no template, no headless CMS.
- An **in-browser terminal** where `help`, `ls`, `open <slug>`, `theme <name>` and a tiny pipeline
  language all work.
- The pipeline language is parsed and evaluated by a **Rust crate (`mini-shell`) compiled to WASM**.
  Example pipelines you can type on the live site:

  ```sh
  sh "projects | lang rust | count"
  sh "projects | grep chess | names"
  sh "projects | stars >= 3 | sort stars desc"
  ```

- Press <kbd>?</kbd> anywhere on the page to jump focus into the terminal.
- Three colour themes baked in: `matrix`, `amber`, `mono` — run `theme amber` inside the terminal.

## What I build & why I love it

I ship at the boundaries — Rust doing heavy lifting, the web doing presentation, everything glued
with small, hand-rolled tools. My GitHub is basically a sketchbook of that boundary:

- **Agentic AI** — *sentinel*, *continuum*, *AVIL*. Planner/tool loops, continual learning, a
  research paper with a formal self-improving SDLC model.
- **Systems / Rust** — *spdf* (spatial PDF parser), *canvaswm* (infinite-canvas Wayland compositor),
  *fuzzy-search-rs*, *minichess*, *whisper-asr-cli-rs*, *quantrs*, *hexglyph*.
- **Desktop apps** — *MosaicFlow-Svelte* (Tauri 2 infinite-canvas research canvas), *cahier*
  (themeable React PDF reader), *rmd* (plugin-first CodeMirror editor), *SandCode* (offline
  snippet manager), *fkbr* (keyboard-driven mouse control), *Polymine* (hex minesweeper + WebGL).
- **Unusual OSes** — *mineos* (a Linux distro that only runs Minecraft, boot-to-game ≤ 15s),
  *zigos* (x86_64 kernel in Zig from the metal up), *tauri-kiosk* (locked Tauri-app kiosks on
  bare Ubuntu).
- **Creative & tooling** — *monax* & *kodex* (code-animation engines), *framescript* (a tiny
  frame-based language), *ae-reach* & *ae-curves-panel* (90+ After Effects CEP tools).
- **Kanban lineage** — *kan → ekan → rekan* — three iterations of the same idea as web, Electron,
  and a modern reboot.
- **Applied web** — *simpless* (a Laravel e-commerce / storefront platform).

Full curated list, including private projects with thumbnails, lives in
[`src/lib/data/projects.ts`](src/lib/data/projects.ts).

### Hobbies & enthusiasm (from my GitHub)

- **Building my own OS just because.** *mineos* and *zigos* exist for the joy of going low.
- **Infinite canvases & node editors.** *MosaicFlow-Svelte*, *canvaswm*, *monax* — I keep coming
  back to 2D surfaces as a UI primitive.
- **Tiny languages.** *framescript*, the WASM mini-shell in this repo, expression-oriented
  pipelines — if I can write a parser for it, I will.
- **Making terminals beautiful.** *minichess*, *whisper-asr-cli-rs*, this site's terminal.
- **Research & applied AI.** *AVIL* is a full LaTeX paper; *sentinel* is the practical version.

## Looking for work / contact

I'm currently **open to full-time, contract, and research roles** in systems programming,
Rust, applied AI / agentic systems, and developer-tool engineering. Remote-first, happy to
travel.

## Run it locally

Requires Node 20+, pnpm, and the Rust toolchain (`rustup`) plus `wasm-pack`.

```sh
# 1. install JS deps
pnpm install

# 2. install the Rust → WASM toolchain (once)
cargo install wasm-pack

# 3. build the Rust shell to WASM (dev or release)
pnpm wasm:dev     # or: pnpm wasm

# 4. run the dev server
pnpm dev
```

| Script             | What it does                                          |
|--------------------|-------------------------------------------------------|
| `pnpm build`       | WASM + build-time GitHub fetch + production Vite bundle |
| `pnpm preview`     | Preview the production build                          |
| `pnpm fetch:github`| Refresh `src/lib/data/github.generated.ts`            |
| `pnpm check`       | `svelte-check` + `tsc` on the Node-side config        |
| `pnpm test:rust`   | `cargo test -p mini-shell`                            |

### Build-time GitHub pipeline

`scripts/fetch-github.mjs` runs on every build and bakes live data into the bundle:

- the **contribution heatmap** (last 12 months, via GraphQL)
- the **language breakdown** (top 8)
- the **README.md** of every curated project — **including private repos**

It reads a token from `GH_TOKEN` / `GITHUB_TOKEN`, and falls back to
`gh auth token` when you run locally. The generated file
`src/lib/data/github.generated.ts` is **committed** so private READMEs you
fetched locally stay baked into the deployed site — no CI secrets needed.
CI uses the default `GITHUB_TOKEN` to refresh public stats; the fetch
script **merges**, preserving any README it can't re-fetch.

To refresh before pushing:

```sh
pnpm fetch:github     # pulls fresh stats + private READMEs via `gh auth`
git add src/lib/data/github.generated.ts && git commit -m "data: refresh github snapshot"
```

### Keyboard

| Keys                                          | What it does                        |
|-----------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|
| <kbd>⌘</kbd> / <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>K</kbd> | open the command palette            |
| <kbd>/</kbd>                                  | open the palette (when not typing)  |
| <kbd>Esc</kbd>                                | close palette or project modal      |

Project cards open a **case-study modal** (URL-addressable via `#/p/<slug>`)
that renders the repo's README with sanitized HTML (marked + DOMPurify).

# Svelte + TS + Vite

This template should help get you started developing with Svelte and TypeScript in Vite.

## Recommended IDE Setup

[VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) + [Svelte](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=svelte.svelte-vscode).

## Need an official Svelte framework?

Check out [SvelteKit](https://github.com/sveltejs/kit#readme), which is also powered by Vite. Deploy anywhere with its serverless-first approach and adapt to various platforms, with out of the box support for TypeScript, SCSS, and Less, and easily-added support for mdsvex, GraphQL, PostCSS, Tailwind CSS, and more.

## Technical considerations

**Why use this over SvelteKit?**

- It brings its own routing solution which might not be preferable for some users.
- It is first and foremost a framework that just happens to use Vite under the hood, not a Vite app.

This template contains as little as possible to get started with Vite + TypeScript + Svelte, while taking into account the developer experience with regards to HMR and intellisense. It demonstrates capabilities on par with the other `create-vite` templates and is a good starting point for beginners dipping their toes into a Vite + Svelte project.

Should you later need the extended capabilities and extensibility provided by SvelteKit, the template has been structured similarly to SvelteKit so that it is easy to migrate.

**Why `global.d.ts` instead of `compilerOptions.types` inside `jsconfig.json` or `tsconfig.json`?**

Setting `compilerOptions.types` shuts out all other types not explicitly listed in the configuration. Using triple-slash references keeps the default TypeScript setting of accepting type information from the entire workspace, while also adding `svelte` and `vite/client` type information.

**Why include `.vscode/extensions.json`?**

Other templates indirectly recommend extensions via the README, but this file allows VS Code to prompt the user to install the recommended extension upon opening the project.

**Why enable `allowJs` in the TS template?**

While `allowJs: false` would indeed prevent the use of `.js` files in the project, it does not prevent the use of JavaScript syntax in `.svelte` files. In addition, it would force `checkJs: false`, bringing the worst of both worlds: not being able to guarantee the entire codebase is TypeScript, and also having worse typechecking for the existing JavaScript. In addition, there are valid use cases in which a mixed codebase may be relevant.

**Why is HMR not preserving my local component state?**

HMR state preservation comes with a number of gotchas! It has been disabled by default in both `svelte-hmr` and `@sveltejs/vite-plugin-svelte` due to its often surprising behavior. You can read the details [here](https://github.com/rixo/svelte-hmr#svelte-hmr).

If you have state that's important to retain within a component, consider creating an external store which would not be replaced by HMR.

```ts
// store.ts
// An extremely simple external store
import { writable } from 'svelte/store'
export default writable(0)
```
